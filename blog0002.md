## React Hooks
##### By @admin Sep 20 2020 12:45 AM.
React hooks is a God sent feature that was introduced in React 16. In old days, if your component did not handle any local state, then you would normally 
write is a stateless functional component. Simple and elegant. Now the problem came if you decided to introduce state to the said component. 
You would need to refactor your functional component to a class based component to enjoy the state & the lifecycles.
Now with the Hook API, you can  easily use state, introduce side effects and so much more. React provides a handful of hooks, 
but the most widely used are:- `useState()`, `useEffect()` and `useReducer()`. 
>Notice how these hooks are conveniently named, `useState()` for state, `useEffect()` for side effects etc. Its not a mistake as we will come see when creating custom hooks.

In this mini series we will look at each more deeply, starting with the easiest and perhaps the most popular, `useState()`.

* ### useState()
With a single line of code, you can introduce state to a functional component (How cool?... I know). That's how powerful hook API is. 
```js
const [timer, setTimer] = React.useState(0);
```
Notice the ES6 destructuring synatx.
The useState() hooks takes in an initial state and returns the current state and a function to update the state.
> Note: `useState()` can only be used in functional components

This is how our complete timer might look like as a functional component

```js
const Timer = () = > {
    const [timer, setTimer] = React.useState();

    // Lets have an event handler that updates the state
    const handleClick = () => {
        setState(timer + 1);
    }

    return (<div>
    <p onClick={handleClick()}>{timer}</p>
    </div>);
}
```

The only downside of `useState()` is managing complex state. Although you can use as many useState() hooks as possible, soon they will clatter your code and well, 
it will look like a mess. That's where `useReducer()` hook comes to play. We will explore it later in the mini series.
